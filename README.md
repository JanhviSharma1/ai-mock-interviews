## Why Prepwise?

Traditional interview preparation often involves reading questions, rehearsing alone, or relying on inconsistent peer feedback. These methods don't simulate the real-time pressure and unpredictability of live interviews.

**Prepwise solves this by:**

- Allowing users to **speak naturally** with AI voice agents
- Creating **realistic interview dynamics** through voice interaction
- Generating **role-specific, adaptive questions**
- Helping users build **confidence and fluency** in speaking

This approach bridges the gap between solo preparation and real-world interviews by offering a more immersive, accessible, and scalable solution for interview practice.
